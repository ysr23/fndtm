## ISSUE                            
- nickel won't parse times without a day:
`n = Nickel.parse("walk joe 9pm")`
- nickel crashes on time like
 `fri 20:30 element 19 Albion Street Illians birthday`

## CSS                                
~~Make each row collapsible~~                                                                                                                                                                                
~~like [pullman apartments][13]~~                                                                                                                                                                             
now done. but perhaps change icon [as shown here][15]                                                                                                                                                     
## Tags                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Probably not use [acts as taggable][2]. Rolling my own as outlined in [railscasts][4] seems better option.  To do this want to use [nested sets][11] ideally.                                             
## Misc                                                                                                                                                                                                   
[update on index view:][1]                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                  
allow notes to be fully MD compliant: http://railscasts.com/episodes/272-markdown-with-redcarpet - move this doc to internal notes.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Calendars                                                                                                                                                                                              
Probably will use [this date picker][9]                                                                                                                                                                   
actually [this looks better][14]

## Recurring Events                                                                                                                                                                                       
[ice cube for recurring events][5]

[this stack overflow][12]                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Devise                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Notes on having [login on any page][7]                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Needed [this][6] to allow the user to be redirected to the sign-in page without being logged in                                                                                                           
This is not really important as next step is to allow a [Guest User][3]                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Settings                                                                                                                                                                                               
Going to use [settings][10] for things like                  
- Default period for new task (i.e. today, next hour, tomorrow)
